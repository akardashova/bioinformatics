1. Percentage of normally distributed genes among breast cancer samples
2. Searching for genes coexpressed with transcription factor SP1 in healthy breast cells.
3. Analysis of the expression of ESR1, PGR, ERBB2 and MKI67 genes in different subtypes of breast cancer. Comparison with PCA visualization.
4. Comparison of SVM models for breast cancer recurrence classification based on all genes and a sample of 11 genes.
5. Comparison of classifiers for determining the subtype of breast cancer (luminal A vs. luminal B): linear SVM, 
linear SVM (top-2 features) and logistic regression.
