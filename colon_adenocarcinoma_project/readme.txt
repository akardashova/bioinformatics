1. Finding the top 10 most highly expressed genes. Expression units are normalized using DESeq2 RPKM.
2. Finding the top 10 genes with the smallest spread of expression between samples (housekeeping genes). 
Expression units are normalized using DESeq2 RPKM.
3. Finding 10 genes whose average expression varies most between cancer and the norm. 
Expression units are normalized using DESeq2 RPKM.
4. Comparison of the top 10 most differentially expressed genes according to the Student's t-criterion and DESeq2.
