1. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV coronaviruses by amino acid sequences of NSP12 protein Spike proteins.
2. Estimation of the average number of mutations in Spike and NCP12 proteins in SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus sequences
(Russian samples) relative to the Wuhan reference.
3. The most frequent single nucleotide substitution in a Spike protein.
4. Finding the most evolutionarily close and most distant viruses (among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, 
HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E), based on the score of alignment of their genome sequences.
5. Creating a hash table for the k-mers of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Searching for the minimum value of k, 
at which exactly one position corresponds to each fragment.
6. t-SNE visualization of different types of coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63,
HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV).
