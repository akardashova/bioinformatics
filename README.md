# bioinformatics
Several projects and works from the bioinformatics course   
* global_aligners: <br>Programs calculate the optimal global alignment of two sequences using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, using a DNAfull penalty matrix and an affine or linear gap penalty.<br>
* mapper: <br>The mapper based on the construction of a hash table for the reference genome. The program accepts a genome in FASTA format, the number k, creates a hash table and saves it to a file. After that, it reads this file and reads in FASTQ format and performs mapping of the reads (without gaps).<br>
